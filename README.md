# Project Name
> House Price Prediction for Surprise Housing company
 
Aim:
To model the price of houses with the available Data. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the features of the house. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a housing market.

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house

- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

- Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression

  This is Upgrad study project, to buid Ridge and Lasso regression model  

- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?

  Finding the dependent factors for house price

 
## Conclusions
 
Optimal value for lambda are

For Ridge : 100
For Lasso : 500

Variables which are significant in predicting the price of a house are
